                            <p>Welcome to Middle School Orchestra class! I'm very excited to be making music with your students this year. Though it may be a little different from what you're used to, this class will focus on developing creative performing musicians, rather than developing those that perform the creative works of others. We'll be exploring lots of different genres, or maybe some new ones that the students will make up! There aren't any requirements for this class other than a willingness to learn and time to practice on their own.<br><br>Feel free to contact me any time via email if you have questions. I'll get back to you as soon as I'm back in school, which is between 7AM-4PM</p>

                            <p>The orchestra classroom will be a positive learning environment for every student. There will be a zero-tolerance policy for bullying and the students will develop their ability to give positive feedback to their classmates. I want my students to enjoy music and enjoy orchestra class, so this will be a very low-stress environment. </p>

                            <p>When I was a middle school student, I loved my music class. I learned how to improve my technical skill on my violin and I 
                            learned how to improve my ability to play in an ensemble. However, the biggest thing my education was lacking was <i>creativity</i>.
                            In my future lessons, I'd like to develop lesson plans that encourage students to use what they know about music to develop their own ideas. 
                            This can be a very slow process so many educators find this method to be inefficient because they're focused on preparing a concert to impress parents and administrators,
                            but I believe that it is more important for a student to learn something that will stay with them for a long time. <br><br>
                            However, I am not the first educator to suggest this. Carl Orff was one of the most influential figures in introducing improvisation and 
                            creativity to the classroom. In the 1920s, Orff and Dorothee Gunther opened a new kind of music school, one where they focused on learning
                            music through self-discovery and experimenting with music elements. They called this school the <i>Guntherschule</i>. Students that attended 
                            the Guntherschule recieved a holistic music education, one that taught them to think independently as musicians and develop their own ideas.<br><br>
                            If a student is able to develop their own ideas in a creative context, they have everything they need to know in order to develop their own ideas 
                            in an english class or history class. Being able to read notation and create music from it is not too different from reading a book or news story
                            and developing your own opinion from it. </p>
